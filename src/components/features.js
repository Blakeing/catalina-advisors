            When a business experiences softness in the market, it can be
            difficult for management to work with existing lenders. Not only
            must a management team continue to operate the business in a tough
            environment, but it must also be concerned about its bank! Catalina
            can help. We are owned and operated by former bankers and are
            experienced in working through challenging loan situations. Whether
            you simply need another voice in the room or need Catalina to take
            the lead on a full restructuring process, we help companies navigate
            the difficulties associated with loan modification and
            restructuring.

            Management teams get pulled in many different directions. It can be
            difficult to prioritize your bank reporting over other operational
            demands of your business, which can cause tension between you and
            your lender. Catalina can help. We do the heavy lifting when it
            comes to your bankâ€™s financial reporting, compliance, and borrowing
            base requirements. Also, we assist management teams in identifying
            performance trends, addressing liquidity constraints, and remaining
            in full compliance of all loan reporting requirements.
